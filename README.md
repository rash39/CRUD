Baby Tracker Web Application
This is a simple web application built using Flask and SQLAlchemy for tracking baby-related events. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on baby events.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you set up and run the application on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Python (>= 3.6)
PostgreSQL
pip (Python package manager)
Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/baby-tracker.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd baby-tracker
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux:

bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the Database:

Open app.py and find the following line:

python
Copy code
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://postgres:newpassword@localhost/baby-tracker'
Replace 'postgresql://postgres:newpassword@localhost/baby-tracker' with your PostgreSQL database URI.

Create the database tables and initialize the application context:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Running the Application
To run the Flask application, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
flask run
The application will start locally, and you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:5000.

Usage
The home page (/) displays a simple greeting message.

Use the following endpoints for CRUD operations on baby events:

Create Event: POST /event
Get All Events: GET /event
Get Single Event: GET /event/<id>
Delete Event: DELETE /event/<id>
Update Event: PUT /event/<id>
